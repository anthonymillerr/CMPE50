With three or four    loggerheads amongst three or four 
score   hogsheads.     I have sounded     the very 
  base-string of humility.  Sirrah,   I am   sworn brother 
to a leash of drawers;    and can call them all by 
their christen names, as Tom,    Dick, and Francis. 
  They take it already upon       their salvation, that 
though I be but the prince of    Wales, yet I am king 
of   courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud   Jack, 
   like Falstaff, but a    Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a 
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me,   and when I 
am king of    England, I shall    command all the good 
lads in Eastcheap.
